 ðŸ“Š **Data Analysis Project**

This project provides interactive insights from four key analyses, focusing on life expectancy, income trends, cell phone adoption, and happiness scores. The analysis was conducted using **Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn)** and includes clear, well-formatted visualizations.

ðŸš€ **Tasks Overview**

**ðŸŒŽ Life Expectancy:** The analysis explores how life expectancy has changed globally over time. A line chart visualizes steady growth patterns, highlighting regional differences and trends across decades.

**ðŸ’° Income Trends:** This section tracks average income trends over the years. The line chart reveals economic growth patterns and disparities between different regions, offering insights into income inequality and financial development.

**ðŸ“± Cell Phone Adoption:** Here, the analysis focuses on the rise of cell phone adoption per person across various countries. A multi-line chart compares adoption rates, showing rapid technological uptake and highlighting regional gaps in technology access.

**ðŸ˜Š Happiness Score:** The happiness score analysis uses World Happiness Report data to visualize how happiness trends vary between countries. The multi-line chart provides a socio-economic perspective on well-being across the globe.
