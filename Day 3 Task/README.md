### 🚀 **Tasks Overview**

#### 1️⃣ **Life Expectancy Chart**
- **Objective:** Visualize how average life expectancy has changed over time.
- **Approach:**
  - Loaded dataset using `pandas`.
  - Created a **line chart** with **Matplotlib**, using **Year** on the X-axis and **Average Life Expectancy** on the Y-axis.
- **Result:** A line chart showing clear life expectancy trends over time.
- **Key Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`

#### 2️⃣ **Income Chart**
- **Objective:** Track average income growth across years.
- **Approach:**
  - Extracted relevant income data.
  - Used **Seaborn** to plot a **line chart** with **Year** on the X-axis and **Average Income** on the Y-axis.
- **Result:** A well-formatted line chart showing income trends.
- **Key Libraries:** `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib.pyplot`

#### 3️⃣ **Rise of Cell Phones**
- **Objective:** Compare cell phone adoption per person across multiple countries.
- **Approach:**
  - Processed dataset to extract relevant columns.
  - Plotted a **multi-line chart** with **Year** on the X-axis and **Cell Phones per Person** on the Y-axis using **Matplotlib**.
- **Result:** A comparative multi-line chart displaying cell phone adoption trends across countries.
- **Key Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`

#### 4️⃣ **Happiness Score**
- **Objective:** Analyze happiness score trends for various countries.
- **Approach:**
  - Selected **Happiness Score (WHR)** data from the dataset.
  - Plotted multiple country trends on a **multi-line chart** using **Seaborn**.
- **Result:** A chart visualizing happiness trends across different countries.
- **Key Libraries:** `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib.pyplot`
