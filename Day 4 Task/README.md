# 📊 **Data Analysis Project Summary**

This project includes four data analysis tasks completed using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebook**. The tasks cover data bias exploration, customer segmentation, churn prediction, and trend analysis. Visualizations were created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for better understanding.

### 🚀 **Completed Tasks Overview**

#### 1️⃣ **Understanding & Exploring Data Bias**
- **What was done:**
  - Generated AI responses to detect potential biases (e.g., assumptions about handedness).
  - Documented common AI biases that can affect data interpretation.
- **Key Output:** A list of identified biases in AI-generated responses.

---

#### 2️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Exploration (Telco Customer Churn Dataset)**
- **What was done:**
  - Loaded and explored the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
  - Identified columns like gender, senior citizen status, and payment methods that could introduce bias.
- **Key Output:** A list of bias-causing columns and their impact on churn analysis.

---

#### 3️⃣ **Customer Segmentation**
- **What was done:**
  - Cleaned data and managed missing values.
  - Segmented customers based on demographics, geography, and usage behavior.
  - Created visualizations (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots) to represent customer groups.
- **Key Output:** Segmentation report with clear visualizations showing customer clusters.

---

#### 4️⃣ **Identify Customer Churn Indicators**
- **What was done:**
  - Conducted correlation analysis on dataset features.
  - Identified top features most related to customer churn.
  - Documented reasons why customers are churning.
- **Key Output:** A list of top churn predictors supported by correlation charts.

### ⚡ **Key Insights from All Tasks**

- 🧪 **Bias Analysis:** AI-generated content can contain assumptions that impact results.
- 🏢 **Churn Factors:** Gender, age, and payment preferences influence churn predictions.
- 👥 **Customer Groups:** Clear customer segments emerge when analyzing usage and demographic patterns.
- 🔑 **Churn Predictors:** Features like contract type, tenure, monthly charges, and tech support availability strongly correlate with churn.
