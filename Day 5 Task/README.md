# 📊 **NLP and IPL Commentary Analysis Project**

This project involves three simple and easy-to-understand tasks using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebook**. The tasks include creating a word cloud, extracting match details from IPL commentary using regular expressions, and converting text into vectors using **scikit-learn**. Visualizations were created using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **WordCloud** for better understanding.

### 🚀 **Tasks Completed**

#### 1️⃣ **Commentary Word Cloud**
- **What was done:**
  - Cleaned IPL commentary by removing common words like "the", "a", and "and".
  - Created a **word cloud** showing the most frequent words in the commentary.
- **Output:** A colorful **Word Cloud** highlighting important cricket-related terms.

#### 2️⃣ **Commentary to Table**
- **What was done:**
  - Extracted key details from the commentary using **regular expressions**, including:
    - ✅ **Bowler Name**
    - ✅ **Batter Name**
    - ✅ **Ball Type** (e.g., yorker, bouncer)
    - ✅ **Shot Type** (e.g., boundary, single)
    - ✅ **Ball Speed** (in km/h)
    - ✅ **Runs Scored**
  - Created a **line chart** to visualize the rise of cell phones per person over time.
- **Output:** A **table** with match details and a **line chart** comparing cell phone usage trends.

#### 3️⃣ **Text Pre-processing with scikit-learn**
- **What was done:**
  - Used two methods to convert text into vectors:
    - ✅ **CountVectorizer():** Shows how many times each word appears.
    - ✅ **TfidfVectorizer():** Shows how important a word is in the text.
  - Explained how this process is important for training language models like **ChatGPT**.
- **Output:**
  - **CountVectorizer:** Table showing word frequency.
  - **TfidfVectorizer:** Table showing word importance scores.

---

### ⚡ **Key Takeaways**

- 🌟 **Word Cloud:** Shows the most common words in IPL commentary.
- 🏏 **Match Details Table:** Lists important match information like players, ball type, and runs scored.
- 🔠 **Text to Numbers:** Demonstrates how text can be turned into numbers for machine learning tasks.
